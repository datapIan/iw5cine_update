<br/><br/>

**PLEASE NOTE**: As the original mod is in a WIP phase, so will this port be..

This is a port of [Sass' Cinematic Mod](https://github.com/sortileges/iw4cine) for **Call of DutyÂ®: Modern Warfare 3Â®**.

Designed for video editors to create cinematics shots on **Call of DutyÂ®: Modern Warfare 3Â®**.


This mod creates new dvars combined as player commands. They are all associated to script functions that are triggered when the dvar doesn't equal it's default value, meaning these functions will all independently stay idle until they get notified to go ahead.

This mod was also designed as a Multiplayer mod only. It will not work in Singleplayer or Zombies.


<br/><br/>
## Requirements

In order to use the latest version of this mod directly from the repo, you'll need a copy of **Call of DutyÂ®: Modern Warfare 3Â®** with **[Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw)** installed. This mod may also work on [Open-IW5]()This mod was built on the Plutonium version of Modern Warfare 3.

<br/><br/>

- Plutonium full path: `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\iw5`

Then, open your game, open the in-game console with `~`, and type `/fs_game mods/iw5cine`.

You can also create a shortcut of your client's executable and add the following parameter to the target line : `+set fs_game "mods/Cinematic Mod"`. This will automatically launch the mod when you open the game.

Alternatively, you can edit the included `.bat` file to run the game with the mod loaded automatically for Plutonium.

**It is not up-to-date with what's in the master branch,** although everything should still work as intended. Just don't be surprised if something is missing or not working as expected!

Once [Sass](https://github.com/sortileges) finishes the mod's rewrite, the HTML file will be updated accordingly.
